  ## __Description__
  This site is my personal portfolio site that tells the viewer a little bit about me and my three top coding projects that I have worked on since I started this course. These projects include my first group project of the course as well as two exemplary assignments: both highlight my javascript skills and the weather dashboard showcase my UI design skills in addition to the javascript.
